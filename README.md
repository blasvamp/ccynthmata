# ccynthmata
 Generalized module for creating WebMIDI CC Controllers

 *This is still very much in alpha right now - please don't actually use it for anything yet because it's very very likely that things will change*

## TODO:
Pretty much everything right now...

In particular:
* Try every option to attach events in order of "usefulness" (oninput first, if notpresent, onchange etc.) in tryAttachParameterChangeHandler
* Patch serialization/deserialization
